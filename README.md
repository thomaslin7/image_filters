## ðŸ”¬ Fundamentals

### What is Image Filtering?

Image filtering is a fundamental operation in computer vision where we apply mathematical operations to modify pixel values based on their neighbors. This is typically done using **convolution** - sliding a small matrix (called a **kernel** or **filter**) over the image.

### Convolution Process

1. **Kernel Placement**: Place the kernel over a region of the image
2. **Element-wise Multiplication**: Multiply corresponding elements
3. **Summation**: Sum all products to get the new pixel value
4. **Sliding**: Move the kernel to the next position and repeat

```
Kernel: [1/9  1/9  1/9]
       [1/9  1/9  1/9]
       [1/9  1/9  1/9]

This creates a 3x3 averaging filter
```

## ðŸŽ¨ Filter Types

### Averaging Filter

**File**: `averaging_filter.py`

**Purpose**: Smoothing/blurring images by averaging pixel values in a neighborhood.

**Kernel**: Uniform weights (all elements equal)
```python
# 25x25 averaging kernel
averaging = cv.blur(img, (25, 25))
```

**Applications**:
- Noise reduction
- Pre-processing for other operations
- Creating soft, blurred effects

### Gaussian Filter

**File**: `gaussian_filter.py`

**Purpose**: Smoothing with weighted averaging based on Gaussian distribution.

**Kernel**: Gaussian weights (center pixels have higher influence)
```python
# Gaussian blur with 21x21 kernel, sigma=10
gaussian = cv.GaussianBlur(img, (21, 21), 10)
```

**Applications**:
- Advanced noise reduction
- Pre-processing for edge detection
- Creating natural-looking blur effects

### Median Filter

**File**: `median_filter.py`

**Purpose**: Noise reduction, especially effective against salt-and-pepper noise.

**Kernel**: Replaces each pixel with the median value of its neighborhood
```python
# 5x5 median filter
median = cv.medianBlur(noisy_img, 5)
```

**Applications**:
- Salt-and-pepper noise removal
- Preserving edges while reducing noise
- Medical imaging preprocessing

### Sharpening Filter

**File**: `sharpening_filter.py`

**Purpose**: Enhancing image details and edges.

**Kernel**: High-pass filter that emphasizes differences
```python
# Define sharpening kernel
kernel = np.array([[0, -1, 0],
                  [-1, 5,-1],
                  [0, -1, 0]])

# Apply sharpening filter
sharpened = cv.filter2D(img, -1, kernel)

```

**Applications**:
- Image enhancement
- Detail recovery after blurring
- Pre-processing for feature detection

### Laplacian Filter

**File**: `laplacian_filter.py`

**Purpose**: Edge detection using second-order derivatives.

**Kernel**: A filter that detects rapid intensity changes
```python
# Laplacian edge detection
laplacian = cv.Laplacian(img, cv.CV_64F)
```

**Applications**:
- Edge detection
- Zero-crossing detection
- Image segmentation

### Sobel Filter

**File**: `sobel_filter.py`

**Purpose**: Directional edge detection using first-order derivatives.

**Kernel**: Separate kernels for horizontal and vertical edges
```python
# Detects vertical edges
sobel_x = cv.Sobel(img, cv.CV_64F, 1, 0)

# Detects horizontal edges
sobel_y = cv.Sobel(img, cv.CV_64F, 0, 1)
```

**Applications**:
- Directional edge detection
- Gradient magnitude and direction
- Feature extraction

## ðŸš€ Running the Examples

### Prerequisites

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib
```

### Execution

Each filter can be run independently:

```bash
python averaging_filter.py
python gaussian_filter.py
python median_filter.py
python sharpening_filter.py
python laplacian_filter.py
python sobel_filter.py
```

### Expected Output

Each script will display:
- **Original Image**: The input image
- **Filtered Image**: The result after applying the filter
- **Comparison**: Side-by-side or multi-panel visualization
