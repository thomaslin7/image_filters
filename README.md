## üî¨ Fundamentals

### What is Image Filtering?

Image filtering is a fundamental operation in computer vision where we apply mathematical operations to modify pixel values based on their neighbors. This is typically done using **convolution** - sliding a small matrix (called a **kernel** or **filter**) over the image.

### Convolution Process

1. **Kernel Placement**: Place the kernel over a region of the image
2. **Element-wise Multiplication**: Multiply corresponding elements
3. **Summation**: Sum all products to get the new pixel value
4. **Sliding**: Move the kernel to the next position and repeat

```
Kernel: [1/9  1/9  1/9]
        [1/9  1/9  1/9]
        [1/9  1/9  1/9]

This creates a 3x3 averaging filter
```

## üé® Filter Types

### Averaging Filter

**File**: `averaging_filter.py`

**Purpose**: Smoothing/blurring images by averaging pixel values in a neighborhood.

**Kernel**: Uniform weights (all elements equal)
```python
# 25x25 averaging kernel
averaging = cv.blur(img, (25, 25))
```

**Applications**:
- Noise reduction
- Pre-processing for other operations
- Creating soft, blurred effects

### Gaussian Filter

**File**: `gaussian_filter.py`

**Purpose**: Smoothing with weighted averaging based on Gaussian distribution.

**Kernel**: Gaussian weights (center pixels have higher influence)
```python
# Gaussian blur with 21x21 kernel, sigma=10
gaussian = cv.GaussianBlur(img, (21, 21), 10)
```

**Applications**:
- Advanced noise reduction
- Pre-processing for edge detection
- Creating natural-looking blur effects

### Median Filter

**File**: `median_filter.py`

**Purpose**: Noise reduction, especially effective against salt-and-pepper noise.

**Kernel**: Replaces each pixel with the median value of its neighborhood
```python
# 5x5 median filter
median = cv.medianBlur(noisy_img, 5)
```

**Applications**:
- Salt-and-pepper noise removal
- Preserving edges while reducing noise
- Medical imaging preprocessing

### Sharpening Filter

**File**: `sharpening_filter.py`

**Purpose**: Enhancing image details and edges.

**Kernel**: High-pass filter that emphasizes differences
```python
# Define sharpening kernel
kernel = np.array([[0, -1, 0],
                  [-1, 5,-1],
                  [0, -1, 0]])

# Apply sharpening filter
sharpened = cv.filter2D(img, -1, kernel)

```

**Applications**:
- Image enhancement
- Detail recovery after blurring
- Pre-processing for feature detection

### Laplacian Filter

**File**: `laplacian_filter.py`

**Purpose**: Edge detection using second-order derivatives.

**Kernel**: A filter that detects rapid intensity changes
```python
# Laplacian edge detection
laplacian = cv.Laplacian(img, cv.CV_64F)
```

**Applications**:
- Edge detection
- Zero-crossing detection
- Image segmentation

### Sobel Filter

**File**: `sobel_filter.py`

**Purpose**: Directional edge detection using first-order derivatives.

**Kernel**: Separate kernels for horizontal and vertical edges
```python
# Detects vertical edges
sobel_x = cv.Sobel(img, cv.CV_64F, 1, 0)

# Detects horizontal edges
sobel_y = cv.Sobel(img, cv.CV_64F, 0, 1)
```

**Applications**:
- Directional edge detection
- Gradient magnitude and direction
- Feature extraction

## üöÄ Running the Examples

### Prerequisites

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib
```

### Execution

Each filter can be run independently:

```bash
python averaging_filter.py
python gaussian_filter.py
python median_filter.py
python sharpening_filter.py
python laplacian_filter.py
python sobel_filter.py
```

### Expected Output

Each script will display:
- **Original Image**: The input image
- **Filtered Image**: The result after applying the filter
- **Comparison**: Side-by-side or multi-panel visualization

## üìù Homework

Design a creative, student-driven mini-project to solve a real image problem using 2D convolution and classic filters. Aim to finish in about 60 minutes.

### Instructions

- Use your own photo (phone/real-life) or a public image; you may also use `afa_innovation.png` for comparison.
- Define a concrete problem present in the image (e.g., noise, blur, low contrast, weak edges). You can also inject a controlled problem (e.g., add Gaussian noise or salt-and-pepper noise, motion blur, low-light).
- Work from first principles: you may reference the example scripts, but do not follow them step-by-step. Make design choices and justify them.
- Create a `results/` folder to save outputs and a short write-up.

### Tasks

1. Problem Statement & Data
   - Pick 1‚Äì3 images and write 2‚Äì3 sentences describing the target problem you want to fix (or simulate).
   - If you inject a problem, briefly describe how (type and level of noise/blur).

2. Baseline & Diagnostics
   - Show the original image(s) and any problem-injected version(s).
   - Optionally visualize helpful diagnostics (e.g., histogram, gradient magnitude) to motivate your approach.

3. Competing Filters (choose at least two for the same goal)
   - Examples: Averaging vs Gaussian (denoise/blur), Median vs Gaussian (salt-and-pepper), Sobel vs Laplacian (edges), Sharpen vs Unsharp-Mask style (edge/detail).
   - Apply both approaches and save results. Keep the problem and evaluation consistent across methods.

4. Parameter Exploration
   - Vary key parameters (kernel sizes, sigma, thresholds) and save representative outcomes.
   - Record the exact parameters that produced your best and worst results and explain why.

5. Custom Kernel
   - Design your own 3√ó3 or 5√ó5 kernel (e.g., custom sharpen/emboss/edge) and apply it using `cv.filter2D` or similar.
   - Compare its effect to a standard filter for the same goal.

6. Build a Simple Pipeline
   - Create a small end-to-end pipeline tailored to your problem (e.g., grayscale ‚Üí denoise ‚Üí contrast adjust/sharpen ‚Üí edge detection/threshold).
   - Demonstrate that it improves the image for the intended task and works on at least one real-life image.

7. Comparison & Reflection
   - For each comparison (e.g., blur vs blur, edge vs edge, sharpening approaches), write 2‚Äì3 insights about trade-offs and visual quality.
   - Note the challenges you faced (artifacts, parameter sensitivity, runtime, generalization) and how you addressed them.

### Deliverables

- `results/` folder containing:
  - Original and problem-injected images (if used)
  - Outputs of each competing filter and your pipeline
  - Output from your custom kernel
- A short `HOMEWORK.md` (bullet points are fine) including:
  - Parameters used (kernel sizes, sigma, thresholds)
  - 2‚Äì3 insights per comparison and a one-paragraph pipeline summary
  - Challenges you faced and how you iterated (a brief progress log is encouraged)

### Optional Extensions (if time permits)

- Test your pipeline on a second, different image and note what changed.
- Use `draw_grids.py` or matplotlib to create a compact comparison figure.
